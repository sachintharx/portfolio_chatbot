## 💡 Tips

- **Both services must be running** for the chatbot to work
- **Backend port:** 3001
- **Frontend port:** 3000
- **Refresh the page** if chatbot doesn't respond (backend might be starting)
- **Check browser console** for any connection errors

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Chatbot doesn't respond?
1. Check backend is running on port 3001
2. Open browser console (F12) to see errors
3. Verify `.env` has correct API URL

### Port already in use?
```powershell
# Check what's using port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Stop and restart
Ctrl+C in terminal, then npm start again
```

### CORS errors?
Backend has CORS enabled by default. If issues persist:
1. Restart backend server
2. Restart React app
3. Clear browser cache
